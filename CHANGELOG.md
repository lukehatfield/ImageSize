# 1.0.2

- Add parse_path parameter to parse plugins in the path parameter (say that ten times fast!) (see read me for how it works)

# 1.0.1

- Modify image tag to work as {{ imagesize }} (not {{ imagesize:get }}), now that Iâ€™ve figured out how to do it.

# 1.0.0

- Initial commit. Welcome to the world, my little add-on. Go forth and do good!
